# EX 2B BACKTRACKING - NQUEEN PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking, which places N queens on an N*N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

## Algorithm
1. Place one queen in each column starting from the leftmost column.
2. For each column, try placing a queen in all rows one by one.
3. Check if the current position is safe (no queen in same row, upper/lower diagonals).
4. If safe, place the queen and move to the next column recursively.
5. If placing leads to no solution, backtrack and try the next row.
